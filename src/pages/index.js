        <h1>Hello new friend ðŸ‘‹</h1>

        <p>
            Welcome to Swizec's Data visualization with React & D3v4 workshop.
        </p>

        <p>
            Usually this is a 2 day workshop that starts with the basics of
            React and ends with beautiful visualizations. At Reactathon we're
            focusing on the visualization part.
        </p>
        <p>
            To get the most out of this workshop, you should be familiar with ðŸ‘‡
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>React</li>
            <li>ideas behind componentization</li>
            <li>stateful rendering</li>
            <li>JSX</li>
            <li>modern ES6+ syntax</li>
            <li>component lifecycles</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>But fear not!</strong>
        </p>
        <p>I am here to guide you. We'll go through everything together.</p>
        {/* <p>
            Today we're going to build your first webapp with React and Friends.
            We're going to use React to build components, React Router for
            routing, styled components for styling, and Redux for state
            management.
        </p>
        <p>
            {`<Tomorrow>`} we're going to learn the basics of D3v4, look at
            several strategies for integration with React, then build a gorgeous
            visualization or two.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your 1st day starts at the very beginning:{" "}
            <em>
                Why React? What problem does it solve? What makes it tick?
                What's the ecosystem like? Why are components the future?
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            But fear not, we won't get stuck on the basics. By the end of your
            first, you'll have built a full webapp and understand how it works.
        </p>
        <p>An infinite series of fun gifs like this ðŸ‘‡</p>
        <p>
            <Video src={MortyMindblowers} autoPlay loop />
        </p>
        <p>
            Your 2nd day starts with the idea that you magically remember
            everything and are now a pro. Don't worry if you're not, Swizec is
            here to help and he's going to code everything with you. If you get
            lost, sit back and observe. Checkout the example repo at key points
            so you can catch up.
        </p> */}

        <p>
            By the end of the day you'll have built your first React & D3 data
            visualization. A pair of connected charts that load a static
            datafile and render it as a piechart and a barchart.
        </p>

        <p>
            <Video src={ConnectedDataviz} autoPlay loop />
        </p>
        <p>
            We're gonna keep it simple. React, D3, and Chroma. No Redux or 3rd
            party visualization libraries. Our goal is to really understand how
            things work, not to talk about a thousand libraries you'll forget by
            tomorrow.

            This is an interactive workshop. If you have a question, <b>ask</b>.
            If something doesn't make sense, <b>ask</b>. If something is
            confusing, <b>ask</b>. If I'm not making sense, <b>ask</b>. If your
            code doesn't work, <b>ask</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will write code today. Some code will live on your computer,
            some in the browser.
        </p>
        <p>We will take breaks.</p>

        <p>
            Answering that question will help you get the most out of this
            workshop. You can call your answer out to the group, or just think
            about it.

        <p>
            Code you'll write today works with <b>React 16</b> and uses modern{" "}
            <b>ES6+</b>. We'll assume a development environment created with{" "}
